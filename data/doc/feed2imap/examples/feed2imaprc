# Global options:
# dumpdir: (for debugging purposes) directory where all fetched feeds will be
#   dumped.
# debug-updated: (for debugging purposes) if true, display a lot of information
#   about the "updated-items" algorithm.
# 
# Per-feed options:
# name: name of the feed (must be unique)
# url: HTTP[S] address where the feed has to be fetched
# target: the IMAP URI where to put emails. Should start with imap:// for IMAP
#   and imaps:// for IMAPS.
# min-frequency: (in HOURS) is the minimum frequency with which this particular
#   feed will be fetched
# disable: if set to something, the feed will be ignored
# always-new: feed2imap tries to use a clever algorithm to determine whether
#   an item is new or has been updated. It doesn't work well with some web apps
#   like mediawiki. When this flag is enabled, all items which don't match
#   exactly a previously downloaded item are considered as new items.
#
# If your login contains an @ character, replace it with %40. Other reserved
# characters can be escaped in the same way (see man ascii to get their code)
